# SVC_digit_recognition
Optimizing SCV for digit recognition using MNIST dataset

For this project, I attmpted to create an accurate model for digit recognition using support vector machines. According to literature on this method, I implemented two main forms of preprocessing: digit deskewing and translation (pixel jittering).
